# 3. Contract Surface

## Implemented and planned contract set

The intended FA Local contract surface covers:

- requester trust
- policy artifact
- capability registry
- execution request
- route decision
- execution plan
- execution status
- denial guard
- forensic event
- review package
- friction payload

The currently implemented schema-backed subset is:

- requester trust
- policy artifact
- capability registry
- execution request
- route decision
- denial guard

The remaining contract surfaces are still deferred.

## Current typed surface

The current machine-checked typed surface includes:

- runtime vocabulary enums
- UUID-backed identity types
- UTC timestamp utility
- structured denial guard payloads
- fail-closed helper functions
- requester trust envelope and trust-evaluation context
- policy artifact and capability-rule types
- capability registry and capability-record types
- execution request type
- route-decision, policy-reference, and capability-decision-summary types
- pure approval-posture resolver inputs and context
- schema-name dispatch plus contract load/deserialize helpers

This gives FA Local a stable baseline for deny-by-default behavior with the first contract layer and the first machine-checked decision layer already in place.

## Approval and execution posture

The current vocabulary distinguishes:

- approval posture: `denied`, `review_required`, `explicit_operator_approval`, `policy_preapproved`, `execute_allowed`
- execution state: `denied`, `review_required`, `waiting_explicit_approval`, `admitted_not_started`, `in_progress`, `degraded`, `partial_success`, `completed_with_constraints`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`
- degraded subtype: `degraded_pre_start`, `degraded_in_flight`, `degraded_fallback_equivalent`, `degraded_fallback_limited`, `degraded_partial`, `unavailable_dependency_block`

That split keeps approval authority distinct from execution truth rather than collapsing them into one label set.

## Denial surface

The current denial guard preserves:

- denial reason class
- denial scope
- denial basis
- remediable flag
- review-available flag
- operator-visible summary
- UTC timestamp

This is intentionally narrow, but it already supports fail-closed truth without reducing all denials to generic errors.

## Current pure validation and admission logic

The current pure logic layer can already:

- validate requester-trust envelopes against schema and typed rules
- deny unknown requesters
- deny malformed requester envelopes
- deny environment mismatch
- deny invalid or expired nonce/token posture
- deny missing required policy
- deny invalid policy artifacts
- deny unregistered capabilities
- deny disabled or revoked capabilities
- deny policy/capability mismatch
- resolve deterministic approval posture from requester trust, policy, capability admission, review class, and side-effect posture
- produce typed route decisions for `denied`, `review_required`, `explicit_operator_approval`, `policy_preapproved`, and `execute_allowed`

These checks remain bounded to validation, deny-path admission, and pure decision output.
They do not coordinate execution.

## Current implementation boundary

Schema-backed execution-plan, execution-status, review-package, forensic-event, and friction-payload contracts do not exist yet.

There is also no CLI, daemon, API surface, adapter implementation, execution routing, or runtime coordinator in the current baseline.
